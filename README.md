### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# ðŸ˜„ About Me:

I am a lead software engineer working for an insurance company based in the South East. The very first line of code I'd ever written was from an Usborne book :books:, Guide to Computer Programming, which I typed into my Dad's ZX Spectrum way too many years ago. It was a simple battleship style game that was all just coordinates for output and text for input. However, I was already hooked on the world of computers. 

Now, with over a decade of professional experience, I'm leading a team helping to deliver an Insurance as a Service product based on a microservice architecture. I've worked on many types of projects over the years, delivered AWS serverless solutions for a quote and buy journey, SPA's, a React component library, ASP.Net web applications, ColdFusion sites and built up pipleines in both Gitlab and Team City. Most recently I've built smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain using Solidity and Truffle. Basically, I'm tech agnostic and would consider myself a full stack developer, perhaps with a focus on backend services.

# ðŸš´ Hobbies:

Outside of my day job, I enjoy both playing and developing computer games. I used to compete in competitive esports, where practice, dedication and teamwork were key to success. Currently I have Unity engine game I'm working on where you play the role of a special forces agent attempting to sneak into the enemy base and complete your mission. Influenced by Metal Gear Solid I'm hoping it will bring a hint of nostalgia to many fans of the series. 

I have an Ocullus Quest 2 and so obviously had to have a play with that and so in VR, I've a few experiments I've thrown together too. You can find some short (very amature) videos of those over on my youtube channel.
